The goal of libminer is to provide an overview of your R library setup. It is a toy package created as a part of a workshop and not meant for serious use.



## Installation

You can install the development version of libminer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vpourfaraj/libminer")
```

## Example usage

To get a count of installed packages in each of your library locations, use the lib_summary() function:


```{r example}
library(libminer)
lib_summary()

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
